Cimnet is a Linux based open source network simulator that started at end of 2014 using C++/C. Its abstraction of client and switch are almost finished. It also got API that goes in to OS to support upper layer virtualization of network node are almost completed. 

However, right not it's still not very ready to go public.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To do:
-Abstraction of Router: I mean L3
-CLI: so that users don't have go to write their own C++ code
-Better API: there are still some more functionalies can be added, but was not.
